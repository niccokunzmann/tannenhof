You can reach us by car from the highway A4 (exit Waltershausen/Tabarz). After you left, turn south where you can see building vehicles and a crane. Turn right at the first traffic light. After 4km you drive straight at the trafficlight (you can see a gas station on your right). After 1km turn right to enter Tabarz. Follow the street until you reach a square with a bank named "Sparkasse". Turn left. Then you can see the Villa "Tannenhof". Turn left again into "Alexandrinenweg".
